    c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
       Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that
       does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's
       reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;
    d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
    e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or
   controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as
   furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use,
   sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and
   Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
   form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
   documentation describing how to modify
   the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of
   the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
   Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
   this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in
   an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive
   and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to
   distribute the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as
   expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
   Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell,

   must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to
   carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
   recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
   the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
   herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
   under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s)
   of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the
   immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this
   License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,
   merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
   constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original
   Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
   or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for
   loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
   all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall
   not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
   License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
   License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or
   communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make
   a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
   recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights
   to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to
   create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without
   honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and
   international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
   copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair
   dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer
   exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure
   to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
    and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this

    under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination
    shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent
    law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the
    termination of this License.

12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
    seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
    recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
    attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action,
    including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the
    termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
    in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising
    rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For
    legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
