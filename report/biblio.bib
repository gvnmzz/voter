abstract = {Social Networking portals have been widely used for expressing opinions in the public domain through internet based text messages and images. Among popular social networking portals, Twitter has been the point of attraction to several researchers in important areas like prediction of democratic electoral events, consumer brands, movie box office, stock market, popularity of celebrities etc. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. In this paper, we introduce the novel approach of exploiting the user influence factor in order to predict the outcome of an election result. We also propose a hybrid approach of extracting opinion using direct and indirect features of Twitter data based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Artificial Neural Networks based supervised classifiers. We combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with SVM in an attempt to perform dimensionality reduction. This paper shows two different case studies of entirely different social scenarios, US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka Assembly Elections 2013. We conclude the conditions under which Twitter may fail or succeed in predicting the outcome of elections. Experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines outperform all other classifiers with maximum successful prediction accuracy of 88\% in case of US Presidential Elections held in November 2012 and maximum prediction accuracy of58\% in case of Karnataka State Assembly Elections held in May 2013.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an analysis of the behavior of Italian Twitter users during national political elections. We monitor the volumes of the tweets related to the leaders of the various political parties and we compare them to the elections results. Furthermore, we study the topics that are associated with the co-occurrence of two politicians in the same tweet. We cannot conclude, from a simple statistical analysis of tweet volume and their time evolution, that it is possible to precisely predict the election outcome (or at least not in our case of study that was characterized by a "too-close-to-call" scenario). On the other hand, we found that the volume of tweets and their change in time provide a very good proxy of the final results. We present this analysis both at a national level and at smaller levels, ranging from the regions composing the country to macro-areas (North, Center, South).},

abstract = {Statistical physics has proven to be a fruitful framework to describe phenomena outside the realm of traditional physics. Recent years have witnessed an attempt by physicists to study collective phenomena emerging from the interactions of individuals as elementary units in social structures. A wide list of topics are reviewed ranging from opinion and cultural and language dynamics to crowd behavior, hierarchy formation, human dynamics, and social spreading. The connections between these problems and other, more traditional, topics of statistical physics are highlighted. Comparison of model results with empirical data from social systems are also emphasized.},

abstract = {Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user’s influence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twit- ter, we present an in-depth comparison of three mea- sures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynam- ics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spon- taneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user. Introduction},

@article{Clifford1973,
abstract = {Two species compete for territory along their mutual boundary. The species are fairly matched and the result of conflict is the invasion by one of the species of territory held by the other. A simple stochastic model for this process is described and rules are given for the calculation, as a function of time, of the probabilities that individual territories and groups of territories are held by a single species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern of territories held by a single species, and here a remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and the case of three-dimensional competition. The process of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign processes, that in which an exchange of territories is arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of species may be beneficial to the community. The implications of the long-term behaviour of such processes are discussed. It is suggested further that, under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life by observing at some time the configuration of territories held by each species.},

@article{Galam2002,
abstract = {The dynamics of spreading of the minority opinion in public debates (a reform proposal, a behavior change, a military retaliation) is studied using a diffusion reaction model. People move by discrete step on a landscape of random geometry shaped by social life (offices, houses, bars, and restaurants). A perfect world is considered with no advantage to the minority. A one person-one argument principle is applied to determine locally individual mind changes. In case of equality, a collective doubt is evoked which in turn favors the Status Quo.Starting from a large in favor of the proposal initial majority, repeated random size local discussions are found to drive the majority reversal along the minority hostile view. Total opinion refusal is completed within few days. Recent national collective issues are revisited. The model may apply to rumor and fear propagation.},

The article investigates various models for the dynamics of continuous opinions by analytical methods as well as by computer simulations. Section 2 develops within a unified framework the classical model of consensus formation, the variant of this model due to Friedkin and Johnsen, a time-dependent version and a nonlinear version with bounded confidence of the agents. Section 3 presents for all these models major analytical results. Section 4 gives an extensive exploration of the nonlinear model with bounded confidence by a series of computer simulations. An appendix supplies needed mathematical definitions, tools, and theorems.},

This is the fact that of all the purchasers of a commodity, some buy from one seller, some from another, in spite of moderate differences of price.

abstract = {It is proposed that motivation may affect reasoning through reliance on a biased set of cognitive processes--that is, strategies for accessing, constructing, and evaluating beliefs. The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions. These ideas can account for a wide variety of research concerned with motivated reasoning.},

Latan\'{e}'s (see record 1982-01296-001) theory of social impact, which specifies principles underlying how individuals are affected by their social environment. Surprisingly, several macrolevel phenomena emerged from the simple operation of this microlevel theory, including an incomplete polarization of opinions reaching a stable equilibrium, with coherent minority subgroups managing to exist near the margins of the whole population. Computer simulations, neglected in group dynamics for 20 years, may, as in modern physics, help determine the extent to which group-level phenomena result from individual-level processes.
